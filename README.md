Two Master's projects implemented as Jupyter notebooks, applying Dense Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

- **LOCALIZATION** : predict the subcellular localization of proteins using Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM) derived from protein sequences.

- **MNIST** : classify MNIST digits from noisy image data.
